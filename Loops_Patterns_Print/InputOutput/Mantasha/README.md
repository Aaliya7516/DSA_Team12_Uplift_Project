## Day 6 Problems

### Question 1. Given an array of integers, sort the array according to frequency of elements. That is elements that have higher frequency come first. If frequencies of two elements are same, then smaller number comes first.
```
Eg:
Input:
5
5 5 4 6 4
Output:
 4 4 5 5 6
 Explanation: The highest frequency here is 2. Both 5 and 4 have that frequency. Now since the frequencies are same then smaller element comes first. So 4 4 comes first then comes 5 5. Finally comes 6.
The output is 4 4 5 5 6.
```

[My Solution](https://github.com/AasthaGithub/DSA_Team12_Uplift_Project/blob/master/Loops_Patterns_Print/InputOutput/Mantasha/Day6/P1_SortArrayAccordingToFrequency.cpp)

### Question 2. Given an integer array and a non-negative integer k,count all distinct pairs with difference equal to k, i.e., A[ i ] - A[ j] = k.

 Since, 5 is not perfect square, so floor of square_root of 5 is 2.
 ```
 
 [My Solution](https://github.com/AasthaGithub/DSA_Team12_Uplift_Project/blob/master/Loops_Patterns_Print/InputOutput/Mantasha/Day6/P4_SquareRoot.cpp)
 
 ### Question 5. Given a matrix mat[] of size n x m, where every row and column is sorted in increasing order, and a number x is given. The task is to find whether element x is present in the matrix or not.
 Expected Time Complexity: O(m+n)
 ```
 Eg: 
 Input:
 3 3
3 30 38 44 52 54 57 60 69
62
Output:
0
Explanation: 62 is not present in the matrix, so output is 0.

 ### Question 5. [Merge 2 intervals](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/merge-intervals/)<br>

Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.

**Example 1:**<br>
Given intervals [1,3],[6,9] insert and merge [2,5] would result in [1,5],[6,9].

**Example 2:**<br>
Given `[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]`, insert and merge `[4,9]` would result in `[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]`.
This is because the new interval `[4,9]` overlaps with `[3,5],[6,7],[8,10]`.
Make sure the returned intervals are also sorted.
<br>


[My Solution](https://github.com/AasthaGithub/DSA_Team12_Uplift_Project/blob/master/Loops_Patterns_Print/InputOutput/Mantasha/Day7/P5_MergeTwoInterval.cpp)

 ### Question 6. [Merge 2 overlapping intervals](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/merge-overlapping-intervals/)<br>
 
  Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

**For example:**<br>
Given `[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]`,
return `[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]`.
Make sure the returned intervals are sorted
