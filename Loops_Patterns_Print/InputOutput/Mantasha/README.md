### Question 4: Take the following as input: number <br>
   Write a function which returns true if the number is an armstrong number and false otherwise, where Armstrong number is <br>      defined as follows. A positive integer of n digits is called an Armstrong number of order n (order is number of digits) if. <br>
abcd… = pow(a,n) + pow(b,n) + pow(c,n) + pow(d,n) + …. <br> <br>
1634 is an Armstrong number as 1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 <br>
371 is an Armstrong number as 371 = 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 <br>
OUTPUT: Print boolean output for each testcase. <br>
"true" if the given number is an Armstrong Number, else print "false". <br> <br>
Sample Case -
Input-371
Output-true <br> <br>
