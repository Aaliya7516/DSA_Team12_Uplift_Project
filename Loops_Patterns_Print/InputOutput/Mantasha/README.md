## Day 6 Problems

### Question 1. Given an array of integers, sort the array according to frequency of elements. That is elements that have higher frequency come first. If frequencies of two elements are same, then smaller number comes first.
```
Eg:
Input:
5
5 5 4 6 4
Output:
 4 4 5 5 6
 Explanation: The highest frequency here is 2. Both 5 and 4 have that frequency. Now since the frequencies are same then smaller element comes first. So 4 4 comes first then comes 5 5. Finally comes 6.
The output is 4 4 5 5 6.
```

[My Solution](https://github.com/AasthaGithub/DSA_Team12_Uplift_Project/blob/master/Loops_Patterns_Print/InputOutput/Mantasha/Day6/P1_SortArrayAccordingToFrequency.cpp)

### Question 2. Given an integer array and a non-negative integer k,count all distinct pairs with difference equal to k, i.e., A[ i ] - A[ j] = k.

 Since, 5 is not perfect square, so floor of square_root of 5 is 2.
 ```
 
 [My Solution](https://github.com/AasthaGithub/DSA_Team12_Uplift_Project/blob/master/Loops_Patterns_Print/InputOutput/Mantasha/Day6/P4_SquareRoot.cpp)
 
 ### Question 5. Given a matrix mat[] of size n x m, where every row and column is sorted in increasing order, and a number x is given. The task is to find whether element x is present in the matrix or not.
 Expected Time Complexity: O(m+n)
 ```
 Eg: 
 Input:
 3 3
3 30 38 44 52 54 57 60 69
62
Output:
0
Explanation: 62 is not present in the matrix, so output is 0.

 ### Question 5. [Merge 2 intervals](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/merge-intervals/)<br>

Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.

**Example 1:**<br>
Given intervals [1,3],[6,9] insert and merge [2,5] would result in [1,5],[6,9].

**Example 2:**<br>
Given `[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]`, insert and merge `[4,9]` would result in `[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]`.
This is because the new interval `[4,9]` overlaps with `[3,5],[6,7],[8,10]`.
Make sure the returned intervals are also sorted.
<br>


[My Solution](https://github.com/AasthaGithub/DSA_Team12_Uplift_Project/blob/master/Loops_Patterns_Print/InputOutput/Mantasha/Day7/P5_MergeTwoInterval.cpp)

 ### Question 6. [Merge 2 overlapping intervals](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/merge-overlapping-intervals/)<br>
 
  Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

**For example:**<br>
Given `[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]`,
return `[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]`.
Make sure the returned intervals are sorted

### 2. [Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/top-interview-questions-easy/127/strings/883/)

Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
**Note:** For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

#### [My Solution](https://github.com/AasthaGithub/DSA_Team12_Uplift_Project/blob/master/Loops_Patterns_Print/InputOutput/Mantasha/Day9/P2_ValidPalindrome.cpp)


**Example 1:**
```
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: "race a car"
Output: false
```



### 3. [String To Integer](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/top-interview-questions-easy/127/strings/884/)

Implement `atoi` which converts a string to an integer.

The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.

The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.

If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.

If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.

**Note:**

Only the space character ' ' is considered as whitespace character.
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1]. If the numerical value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (2^31 − 1) or INT_MIN (−2^31) is returned.

#### [My Solution](https://github.com/AasthaGithub/DSA_Team12_Uplift_Project/blob/master/Loops_Patterns_Print/InputOutput/Mantasha/Day9/P3_StringToInteger.cpp)
**Example 1:**
```
Input: "42"
Output: 42
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: "   -42"
Output: -42
Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign.
             Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42.
```                 
**Example 3:**
```
Input: "4193 with words"
Output: 4193
Explanation: Conversion stops at digit '3' as the next character is not a numerical digit.
```
**Example 4:**
```
Input: "words and 987"
Output: 0
Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is 'w', which is not a numerical 
             digit or a +/- sign. Therefore no valid conversion could be performed.
```    
**Example 5:**
```
Input: "-91283472332"
Output: -2147483648
Explanation: The number "-91283472332" is out of the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
             Thefore INT_MIN (−231) is returned.
```


### 4. [Count And Say](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/top-interview-questions-easy/127/strings/886/)

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:
```
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```
```
1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
21 is read off as "one 2, then "one 1" or 1211.
```

Given an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence. You can do so recursively, in other words from the previous member read off the digits, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.

#### [My Solution](https://github.com/AasthaGithub/DSA_Team12_Uplift_Project/blob/master/Loops_Patterns_Print/InputOutput/Mantasha/Day9/P4_CountAndSay.cpp)

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 1
Output: "1"
Explanation: This is the base case.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation: For n = 3 the term was "21" in which we have two groups "2" and "1", "2" can be read as "12" which means frequency = 1 and value = 2, the same way "1" is read as "11", so the answer is the concatenation of "12" and "11" which is "1211".
```
**Note:** Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.


### 5. [Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/top-interview-questions-easy/127/strings/887/)

#### [My Solution](https://github.com/AasthaGithub/DSA_Team12_Uplift_Project/blob/master/Loops_Patterns_Print/InputOutput/Mantasha/Day9/P5_LongestCommonPrefix.cpp)

**Example 1:**
```
Input: ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
```
**Note:**  All given inputs are in lowercase letters a-z.

A valid "croak" means a frog is printing 5 letters ‘c’, ’r’, ’o’, ’a’, ’k’ sequentially. The frogs have to print all five letters to finish a croak. If the given string is not a combination of valid "croak" return -1.

#### [My Solution](https://github.com/AasthaGithub/DSA_Team12_Uplift_Project/blob/master/Loops_Patterns_Print/InputOutput/Mantasha/Day-11/P4_MinimumNumberOfFrogsCroaking.cpp)

Explanation: The minimum number of frogs is two. 
The first frog could yell "crcoakroak".
The second frog could yell later "crcoakroak".
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: croakOfFrogs = "croakcrook"
Output: -1
Explanation: The given string is an invalid combination of "croak" from different frogs.
```
**Example 4:**
```
