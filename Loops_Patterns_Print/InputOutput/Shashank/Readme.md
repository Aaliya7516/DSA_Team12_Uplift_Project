## Day 6 Problems

### Question 1. Given an array of integers, sort the array according to frequency of elements. That is elements that have higher frequency come first. If frequencies of two elements are same, then smaller number comes first.
```
Eg:
Input:
5
5 5 4 6 4
Output:
 4 4 5 5 6
 Explanation: The highest frequency here is 2. Both 5 and 4 have that frequency. Now since the frequencies are same then smaller element comes first. So 4 4 comes first then comes 5 5. Finally comes 6.
The output is 4 4 5 5 6.
```

[My Solution](https://github.com/AasthaGithub/DSA_Team12_Uplift_Project/blob/master/Loops_Patterns_Print/InputOutput/Shashank/Day-6/Day-6--SortArrayAccordingToFrequency-Shashank.cpp)

0
Output:
1
Explanation: There is only one pair with difference 0 i.e (1,1)
```

```
Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Input: [2,2,2,4,2]
Output: 2

```


### 3. For a given array print Repeating & missing no. in O(1) space & O(n) time.
<br>

```
Input:[3 1 2 5 3] 
Output:[3, 4]
```
<br>

### 4. Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.
If the number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively, the resulting size of array A after your code is executed    should be m + n
   <br>
   
 [My Solution](https://github.com/AasthaGithub/DSA_Team12_Uplift_Project/blob/master/Loops_Patterns_Print/InputOutput/Shashank/Day-7/Day-7--Merge2SortedArray-Shashank.cpp)
 ```
   Input : 
         A : [1 5 8]
         B : [6 9]

   Modified A : [1 5 6 8 9]
```

### 5. Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.

**Example 1:**<br>
Given intervals [1,3],[6,9] insert and merge [2,5] would result in [1,5],[6,9].

**Example 2:**<br>
Given `[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]`, insert and merge `[4,9]` would result in `[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]`.
This is because the new interval `[4,9]` overlaps with `[3,5],[6,7],[8,10]`.
Make sure the returned intervals are also sorted.
<br>

[My Solution](https://github.com/AasthaGithub/DSA_Team12_Uplift_Project/blob/master/Loops_Patterns_Print/InputOutput/Shashank/Day-7/Day-7--MergeIntervals-Shashank.cpp)

### 6. Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

**For example:**<br>
Given `[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]`,
return `[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]`.
Make sure the returned intervals are sorted
<br>
