## Day 6 Problems

### Question 1. Given an array of integers, sort the array according to frequency of elements. That is elements that have higher frequency come first. If frequencies of two elements are same, then smaller number comes first.
```
Eg:
Input:
5
5 5 4 6 4
Output:
 4 4 5 5 6
 Explanation: The highest frequency here is 2. Both 5 and 4 have that frequency. Now since the frequencies are same then smaller element comes first. So 4 4 comes first then comes 5 5. Finally comes 6.
The output is 4 4 5 5 6.
```
